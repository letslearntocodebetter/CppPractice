Here’s a concise, one-line summary of each step in the TLS handshake:

1. Client Hello: The client sends a message with supported TLS versions, cipher suites, and a random number.
2. Server Hello: The server selects the TLS version and cipher suite, and sends back a random number.
3. Server Certificate: The server sends its digital certificate to prove its identity.
4. Key Exchange: The server and client exchange keys or key parameters (e.g., Diffie-Hellman parameters).
5. Server Finished: The server sends a message confirming the handshake and all previous messages.
6. Client Key Exchange: The client sends the key exchange information (e.g., pre-master secret).
7. Client Finished: The client sends a message confirming the handshake and validating the server’s messages.
8. Session Established: Both client and server generate session keys and start encrypting data.

Step4 zoom:
Key Exchange (client-side):

1. Once the client has validated the server's certificate, the client proceeds with the key exchange.
2. If using RSA, the client generates a pre-master secret, encrypts it with the server’s public key (from the certificate), and sends it to the server.
3. If using Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DH) or ECDHE, the client generates a temporary private key, calculates a public key, and sends it to the server. The server will similarly generate its own key and exchange its parameters, both sides using their private keys and the other party's public key to compute a shared secret.
4. Session Key Generation:
Once the server receives the key exchange information (whether via RSA or DH/ECDHE), both the client and server use the shared secret to generate symmetric session keys for encrypting the rest of the communication.

- Why is Perfect Forward Secrecy Important?
Security: If an attacker manages to get a server's private key, they cannot decrypt past communications because each session has a unique session key that was discarded after the session ended. This protects past communications even if the server's private key is exposed.
Protection from Key Compromise: If a long-term private key is compromised (e.g., via a server breach or improper storage), PFS ensures that the attacker cannot use that key to decrypt old sessions or gather information from past communications.

Example of PFS Key Exchange (ECDHE):
ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral) is a commonly used PFS mechanism:
Client and Server Exchange Public Keys: Both the client and server exchange public ephemeral keys based on elliptic curve cryptography.
Shared Secret Derivation: Each party uses its private key and the other party’s public key to compute a shared secret.
Session Key Generation: This shared secret is then used to derive a symmetric session key, which is used for encrypting the communication during that session.
Discarding Keys: After the session, the ephemeral keys are discarded, ensuring that there is no long-term exposure of the keys.
