Condition to become true and be notified when it does.

Handling Thread Wait and Wake Up in Condition Variables
A thread waits on a condition variable using:


std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
cv.wait(lock); // Puts the thread to sleep until notified
A thread wakes up another thread using:

cv.notify_one();  // Wakes up one waiting thread
cv.notify_all();  // Wakes up all waiting threads
Spurious Wake-Ups
A spurious wake-up happens when a thread wakes up from cv.wait() without actually being notified by cv.notify_one() or cv.notify_all(). This can happen due to:

OS-level scheduling issues.

The implementation of pthread_cond_wait (which is used internally by std::condition_variable).

Other system-level interrupts.

How to Handle Spurious Wake-Ups?
Always use a predicate (a condition that must be checked after waking up) to ensure that the wake-up was intended:

std::condition_variable cv;
std::mutex mtx;
bool ready = false;

void worker() {
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    cv.wait(lock, []{ return ready; }); // This prevents spurious wake-ups
    // Proceed only if ready == true
}
The lambda [] { return ready; } ensures the thread continues execution only if ready is actually true, preventing spurious wake-ups from causing issues.



void worker() {
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    if (cv.wait_for(lock, std::chrono::seconds(5), [] { return ready; })) {
        std::cout << "Thread resumed after being notified.\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "Thread timed out while waiting.\n";
    }
}


2. How std::condition_variable Works Internally
A condition_variable uses a mutex and a queue to manage waiting threads. The process involves:

(a) Thread Wait (cv.wait())
The thread locks a mutex.

It checks a condition (predicate).

If the condition is false, it unlocks the mutex and enters a waiting state.

The thread is placed in the internal queue of the condition variable.

The thread goes to sleep (OS suspends it).

(b) Thread Wake-Up (cv.notify_one() or cv.notify_all())
Another thread calls cv.notify_one() (wakes up one thread) or cv.notify_all() (wakes up all waiting threads).

The OS selects one or more waiting threads and moves them from the waiting queue to the ready queue.

When a thread wakes up, it reacquires the mutex before proceeding.

(c) Why Is cv.wait() Used with a Mutex?
When a thread is notified, it must reacquire the mutex before checking the condition.

This prevents race conditions where another thread might modify the condition between notification and wake-up.

3. What Causes a Spurious Wake-Up?
A spurious wake-up happens when a thread wakes up from cv.wait() without any notification (notify_one() or notify_all()). This is why wait() is always used with a predicate.

Possible Causes of Spurious Wake-Ups:
(a) OS-Level Scheduling Anomalies
The OS may wake up a thread mistakenly due to internal thread management and scheduling policies.

(b) Signal Interrupts
If the process receives a signal (e.g., SIGALRM from an alarm), the system might wake up a waiting thread.

(c) Implementation of pthread_cond_wait
In Linux, std::condition_variable is implemented using pthread_cond_wait(), which does not guarantee that a thread wakes up only when notify_one() is called.

(d) Hardware/Timer Interrupts
Some hardware events (such as a timer firing) can cause wake-ups.

### **Why Does the Linux Kernel Interrupt a Blocking System Call with `EINTR`?**  

In Linux, a blocking system call (like `read()`, `write()`, `select()`, `poll()`, `sleep()`, `recv()`, etc.) may be **interrupted** and return `-1` with the error `EINTR` (Interrupted System Call).  

### **1. How Does It Work Internally?**  

When a thread calls a **blocking system call**, the kernel puts the thread into a **sleep state** and waits for an event (e.g., data availability, timeout, or signal). However, the system call might be interrupted due to a **signal**.

#### **(a) Normal Blocking System Call Behavior**
1. **User process calls a system call** (e.g., `read(fd, buffer, size)`).
2. **Kernel puts the process to sleep** while waiting for data (e.g., waiting for input from a socket).
3. **When data arrives**, the kernel wakes up the process, completes the system call, and returns.

#### **(b) Interrupted System Call**
1. **User process calls a blocking system call** (e.g., `read()`).
2. **Kernel puts the process to sleep**.
3. **A signal (e.g., `SIGINT`, `SIGALRM`) is received** while the process is sleeping.
4. The kernel **interrupts** the system call, returning `-1` with `errno = EINTR`.
5. The process must **handle the interruption** (e.g., retry the system call).

---

### **2. Why Would the Kernel Interrupt a System Call?**
There are several reasons why the kernel might interrupt a blocking system call:

#### **(a) Signal Delivery**
- If a signal (like `SIGINT`, `SIGALRM`, or `SIGCHLD`) is delivered to a process while it's **sleeping inside a blocking system call**, the kernel wakes up the process.
- If the signal has a **signal handler** (i.e., it's not ignored), the kernel **interrupts** the system call and returns `EINTR`.

##### **Example: `SIGALRM` Interrupting `sleep()`**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void alarm_handler(int signum) {
    std::cout << "Received SIGALRM!\n";
}

int main() {
    signal(SIGALRM, alarm_handler);
    alarm(2);  // Set an alarm for 2 seconds

    int ret = sleep(5);  // This sleep may be interrupted
    if (ret != 0)
        std::cout << "Sleep interrupted with EINTR!\n";

    return 0;
}
```
Here, `sleep(5)` is interrupted by `SIGALRM`, and it returns **before 5 seconds** with `EINTR`.

---

#### **(b) Debugging/Tracing (ptrace)**
- If a process is being traced by `ptrace()`, the kernel may **interrupt system calls** to notify the tracer (like `strace`, `gdb`).

---

#### **(c) System Calls Restarting (`SA_RESTART`)**
- If a signal is received **but** the signal handler was installed using `SA_RESTART`, the kernel **automatically restarts** some interrupted system calls.
- Example:
  ```cpp
  struct sigaction act;
  act.sa_handler = alarm_handler;
  act.sa_flags = SA_RESTART;
  sigaction(SIGALRM, &act, NULL);
  ```
- With `SA_RESTART`, system calls like `read()` or `write()` may **not return `EINTR`** and instead **resume execution automatically**.

---

#### **(d) Kernel-Level Resource Issues**
- Sometimes, if a system call is waiting on a resource (e.g., disk I/O) and the resource is suddenly **deallocated** or becomes **invalid**, the kernel may return `EINTR`.

---

### **3. How to Handle `EINTR` Properly?**
Many system calls must be **retried** if interrupted.

#### **Example: Retrying a `read()` System Call**
```cpp
ssize_t safe_read(int fd, void* buffer, size_t size) {
    ssize_t bytes_read;
    do {
        bytes_read = read(fd, buffer, size);
    } while (bytes_read == -1 && errno == EINTR);
    return bytes_read;
}
```
- If `read()` is interrupted by a signal (`errno == EINTR`), it **retries** instead of failing.

---

### **4. Summary**
| Reason for Interruption | Explanation |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Signal received** | If a process is blocked in a system call and receives a signal, the kernel wakes it up and returns `EINTR`. |
| **ptrace debugging** | If a process is being traced (e.g., `strace`), system calls might be interrupted. |
| **Kernel resource issues** | If a required resource is unavailable or deallocated. |
| **`SA_RESTART` flag** | Some system calls restart automatically instead of returning `EINTR`. |

#### **Best Practice**
- Always check for `EINTR` when using **blocking system calls**.
- Use **`SA_RESTART`** if you want system calls to **resume automatically**.
