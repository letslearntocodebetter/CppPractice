         //This mathematical insight is what allows us to use Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm to detect the cycle and find the exact starting 
         // point of the cycle efficiently. By using the fact that the distance from the head to the start of the cycle is the same as the distance from the mee
         // ting point to the cycle start, we can find the starting node in just one more iteration after detecting the cycle.
